# In The Kitchen

## Overview
- This is a full stack web application that allows users to quickly and easily find and share cooking recipes. A user can browse different food categories by simply clicking any one of the cuisines displayed on the home page. Once the cuisine is clicked, the page will load all the recipes within that category. To personalize the experiance the user can login to the app via google or facebook account. When the user is logged in, they can post their own recipe and save any recipe to their favorites page. The user will also have access to edit their own recipes. Once again, the idea is to make it easy for anyone to share their homecooked recipes and find great recipes while expanding our minds to the creative colenary world.
